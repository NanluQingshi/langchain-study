      "      \"**Short answer:** When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"**Longer explanation:**\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"1. **Sunlight enters the atmosphere**: The sun emits a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, which reaches Earth's surface.\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"2. **Light interacts with atmospheric gases**: As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light.\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"3. **Scattering occurs**: When light hits these gas molecules, they scatter the light in all directions. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after Lord Rayleigh, who first described the phenomenon in 1871.\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"4. **Blue wavelengths scattered more**: The shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered more than the longer (red) wavelengths because of their smaller size and higher frequency. This means that blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere in all directions.\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"**Why we see a blue sky:**\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"When we look up at the sky, we're seeing the combined effect of sunlight being scattered by atmospheric gases. The blue color is dominant because of the way shorter wavelengths are scattered more than longer ones. If you were to observe the sky from space, away from Earth's atmosphere, it would appear black, as there wouldn't be any light scattering.\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"**Other factors that can influence the color of the sky:**\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"1. **Air pollution**: Tiny particles in the air can scatter light and give the sky a hazy or grayish appearance.\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"2. **Dust and water vapor**: Atmospheric conditions like dust storms or high humidity can affect the way light scatters, making the sky appear more red or orange.\\n\" +\n",
      "      \"3. **Sun's position**: The color of the sky changes depending on the time of day (dawn, noon, dusk) and the sun's angle relative to our line of sight.\\n\" +\n",
